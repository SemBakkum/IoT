## Design [Sem Bakkum](https://www.github.com/SemBakkum)

I started out creating a visual inventory to determine which colors and fonts we should use.
For more information about this inventory click on the following link: [Visual inventory](Visual inventory/visualinventory_dashboard.pdf).

With these fundamentals Wesley and I started on coding the design of the website, becaus of the little time we had to complete this project this seemend to be a better idea. 

Wesley started on creating the menu of the website and after I finished the inventory I started on the design of the map we use on the home page. 
I made use of the google maps api wizard to design your own [map](http://googlemaps.github.io/js-samples/styledmaps/wizard/index.html).
